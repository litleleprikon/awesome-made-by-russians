## But why?

A lot of developers in Russia do not know about these projects and the fact that their authors are also Russian programmers. It warms your heart when you understand that a lot of highly popular and useful projects are made by “cold and gloomy” Russians.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/fobbyal/status/1290311704803340288) by [@fobbyal](https://github.com/fobbyal):

> Is there a cool open source project mainly contributed by Russian developers?

...triggered us to create this repo. 

The goal of the project is to show how modern software is a product of global culture. There are many different nations in your `package-lock.json`, or `Gemfile.lock`, or elsewhere. And we are highlighting the Russian part just because we know it better ([#2](https://github.com/igoradamenko/awesome-made-in-russia/issues/2)).

## Contributing 

It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars as a measurement. It's not quite fair, but it is what we have here on Github.

If you want to add project to this list, please, make sure that:

1. The project was created by the developer born in Russia or self-indicate themself as Russian.
2. The project has more that 1000 stars on Github.

If they do, feel free to make a PR!

(Please, check twice that you have picked the correct category and added the project according to alphabetical order.)
